It is only deployed during the critical Harvester Event, acting as the immovable guardian of the Harvester unit. Its incredible durability and lethal arsenal make it the single greatest threat on the map; attempting to scratch its armor alone is a fool's errand—you'll need a full squad of Raiders working in concert just to stand a chance.\n\nIts attacks are devastating:\n\nMortar Barrage: The dome atop the unit launches three massive mortars that land in a cluster around a targeted Raider. Two seconds after impact, they detonate in a fiery, engulfing inferno.\n\nSustained Laser: It periodically sweeps its primary weapon, firing a continuous laser beam at any Raider it acquires in its line-of-sight.\n\nClose-Quarters Deterrents: Should Raiders try to get up close and personal, the Goliath switches modes, delivering either a disruptive EMP pulse to shut down technology or a crushing ground slam to obliterate anything nearby."

            "description": "This is the largest of the rolling ARCs, a massive, spherical construct designed to dominate open ground. Its primary tactic is to stop periodically on the battlefield to transmit disruptive signals, acting as a massive relay for the ARC network. Be warned, however, its most unique (and dangerous) trait is its resilience: as it takes damage, its outer shell breaks apart into many smaller, armored pieces. Its final attack is a relentless one: it will roll directly at high speed toward any Raider it detects, essentially turning itself into a giant, high-impact bowling ball."
